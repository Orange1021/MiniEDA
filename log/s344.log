  Updated RAT for 22 nodes.

[Step 4] Calculating Slacks...
  Slack distribution:
    Positive (> 0): 16 nodes
    Zero (= 0):       0 nodes (critical path)
    Negative (< 0):  0 nodes (timing violations)

========== Timing Summary ==========
Clock Period: 10.0000 ns

Setup Analysis (Max Path - Signal Too Slow):
  WNS (Worst Negative Slack): 0.0000 ns
  TNS (Total Negative Slack): 0.0000 ns
  Violation Count: 0 nodes

Hold Analysis (Min Path - Signal Too Fast):
